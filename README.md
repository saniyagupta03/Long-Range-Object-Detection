# Long-Range-Object-Detection
This project focuses on developing AI models for accurate long-range object detection and classification in challenging environments. The goal is to detect objects such as humans, cars, and drones from significant distances, while accounting for factors like low visibility, poor weather conditions, and motion blur.
